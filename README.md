# mma-arbitrage
This is a web scrapping project to see the odds for UFC fights on different sports books. I am planning on implementing a front-end in React and database in MySQL to display and save the odds.

I used bs4 and python to do the scrapping which can be found in 
/backend/getData. I used Flask for my backend framework. The back-end endpoint can be found in /backend/main. The front-end endpoint can be found in /my-app/src/App.
